# Class 3
## Reading

###Independence

* tenure: flexibility vs independence
 -> length of term, reappointment decision
* remuneration: Minister or remuneration tribunals

> independant to who, and independant to what?
> should tribunal be accountable to courts?

### Procedure
* the minimum of formility but still need procedural fairness and logically probative material (flexibility)
* inquisitorial rather than adversarial, tribunal may suggest how to fill the gap
* legal representation: formility vs important rights
   different measures 
* ADR

> s 25 jurisdiction of AAT ACT, scope of the tribunal


### Transparency
* commonly regulate public proceeding
* reasons for decision 
 * reason from origin decision maker (S 28)
 * reason from tribunal (s 43)
 
* subject to parliament

### Standing and parties

* Re Rudd (airport)
* affected party
* organisation who is substantially affected by the decision
 

### Policy consideration

> consistancy is important

* ***Re Drake***: US citizen, possessing prohibited drug, deportation, whether to apply policy? --yes
* ***Drake(No2)***: not making policy but commenting policy




### Drake [no2]
* court: AAT
* parties: drake and Minister for immigration and ethic affairs
* fact: US citizen, possessing prohibited drug, deportation
* Issue: 
 * what is lawful policy?
 * can att apply policy?
* law: Migration Act 1958 cth s12
* reasoning:

	**what is lawful policy?**
 * multipicity of factors -> no universal rule -> inconsitancy
 * policy can reduce inconsitancy
 * lawful policy should not preclude part of it from consideration for any cases
 * lawful policy should not shut its ears
 * lawful policy not determinative, only restrian the weight

 **how independant should AAT be?**

 * policy would enhance consistancy
 * policy is to make adminitrative decision(public significance) rather than curcial one (is to create right/liability rather than declare/enforce), so tribunal should be less detached to policy consideration. 
 * tribunal should not overide broad policy since otherwise it makes its own policy and affects its independance

 
* results: tribunal should apply ministerial policy unless congent reasons (consistancy less important than justice)


### Drake

* issue: role of AAT
* results:
	* constitutionally permissible for  federal judge to sit on AAT
	* role of AAT: review of administrative decision, de noveo, judicial fairness and detachment
	* tribunalshould decide whether decision is right, rather, not only if admin's decision is reasonable.
	* tribunal should make investigation rather than only supervisory role.

	
### Shi

* fact: 303 fh migration act, licence, orinally in 2003, tribunal in 2005
* court: high court
* issue: tribunal consider new evidence?
* reasoning:
 * nature of AAT: merit review
 * functino of AAT: excercise power and discretion to reach its own decision
 * purpose of AAT: step in the shoes
 * nature of decision: this decision uses all present tense (s 303)
* result: tribunal should use latest eveidence unless statutes states opposite
