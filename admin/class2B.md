## Assessment of Credibility

### Evidence and Finding

* all evidence need to be considerred
* accept new evidence
  * in protection vise, reasonable explanation for new evidence is a must 
* must provide reasons
* presumption of true and real evidence

### hearing

* non-intimitating
* inquisitorial, asking questions to test credibility

### oral evidence

* considerations should be given to each case

### contradiction evidence

* all evidence
* not imply dishonesty but meaning lack of credibility
* not impose too high standard of knowledge

### demeanour

* carefully excercise, however, once asserting, should inform the applicants

### delay for protection

* should be considerred, but not the sole reason

### expert evidence

* should accept and usually not override unless providing clear reason

### documentary evidence

* should be careful
* bogus document may not mean untrue
* protection visa must be rejected when bogus document is provided without reasonable explanation

## Creyke

* common good vs individual right, efficency vs justice
* two definitions of adminitrative justice: include policy consideration/not include policy consideration
