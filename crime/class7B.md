# Extreme Provocation

* Reasonable provocation + loss of self-control
* Partial defence

* *Smith*: crooked timber of humanity
* **R**: Passion is mounting not declining
* **Hill**: context + sudden

## 2014 Reform

* s 23 of Crime Act
* apply to murder only
* Conduct + loss of control + ordinary person


#### Conduct

any conduct -> indicible conduct

***Davis*** : 

* words told by others about the daughter being sexually abused
* dismiss, need hearing or presence of the offence

Words alone rarely count as evidence to justify provocation

* non-violent offence is not a legal term, instead, it is an ordinary term that should be interpreted by the jury
* victim-incited provocation was not available s 23(3)(b)


#### loss of self-control

***Chhay***

* axe killing while sleeping
* loss of control can develop after a lengthy period and without a specific trigger
* Emotions such as hatred, resentment, fear or desire for revenge should not be considered. 

#### Ordinary people test

* **The only objective limb**

***Stingel***

* Jealousy Killing husband's cheating, not loving anymore, age, ordinary test

***Heron***

* ordinary people 'could' do is not the same as they 'must'/'could' do, 'could' denotes a possibility

> ***GENDER CAN NOT BE USED IN SUBJECTIVE TEST***

> Intoxication should not be considered
 
 
#### Rogers v R

**Fact**: Mail finds out his girlfriend still has in connection with gf's bf, he killed before trying to kill himself.

* trial in a trial
* even taking into consideration the PTSD, the court still not satisfied that there is a provocation
* court decided that there is no provocation, no serious offence (since it may be a self-defence), and maybe also no lost of control
