# Defense

**Defence must be proved by prosecution**
> Evidential burden on defendant
> 
> Prosecution must prove the absence of defence
> 
> Insanity and substantial impairment impose heavier burden of proof on defendant


**Negativing factor is different from defense**

> denying of a definitional element
> 
> However, court has placed evidential burden on defence for automatism and intoxication
