## Intoxication

* **Defination:** s 428A

#### Self-induced intoxication

* ***Ainsworth:*** intoxication is rarely be regarded as excuse, instead, it is usually treated as the cause
* **s 428CD**: specific intent(can be considerred), self-induced (cannot be considerred)
* ***Sullivan:*** if evidence is not capable of rasing doubt, judge can choose not to tender issue before jury
* ***Grant:*** 428C should be applied to murder in its all forms 
* ***Maksi:*** effect of intoxication on the capacity to form requisite S intent is separate issue to the formation of that intent

#### Involuntary intoxication

can be take into consideration, however, reasonable person mean reasonable **Sober** Person

#### O'Connor

* wounding police officer with intent to resist arrest
* even self-induced intoxication should also be considerred, since from policy consideration, it is no deterance. From culpability consideration, it is too strict. And analogy of innocent agent as drunken state + guity mind as previous sober state would tell whether the case is "dutch courage" or not.
