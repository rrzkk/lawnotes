## Substantial Impairment

* Partial Defense
* 23A applies to murder
* From the underlying condition

* Not a medical question, but one of culpability and liability

#### Potts
* BoP
* By jury, not expert
* Inconsistency between self-defence and substantial impairment

> intoxication to be disregarded (s 23A3)
> 
> Even if the question has not been raised, the jury should still consider this defence ***Cheatham***
> 
> **TEST**: mental healt/cognitive impairments -->  so substantial


## Intoxication

* **Defination:** s 428A

#### Self-induced intoxication

* ***Ainsworth:*** Intoxication is rarely regarded as an excuse, instead, it is usually treated as the cause
* **s 428CD**: specific intent(can be considered), self-induced (cannot be considered)
* ***Sullivan:*** If evidence is not capable of raising doubt, the judge can choose not to tender an issue before the jury, a risky strategy of self-defence and intoxication are inconsistent. 
* ***Grant:*** 428C should be applied to murder in its all forms 
* ***Majewski:*** effect of intoxication on the capacity to form requisite S intent is a separate issue to the formation of that intent

#### Involuntary intoxication

can be taken into consideration, however, reasonable person means reasonable **Sober** Person (***s428F***)

#### O'Connor

* wounding police officer with intent to resist arrest
* even self-induced intoxication should also be considered, since from policy consideration, it is no deterrence. From culpability consideration, it is too strict. An analogy of the innocent agent in a drunken state + guilty mind in a previously sober state would tell whether the case is "Dutch courage" or not.
