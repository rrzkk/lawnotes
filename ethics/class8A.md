# Conflicting Loyalties

* equity, contract, and SR
* Adversarial advocacy (SR) vs Responsible Lawyer (Equity)

## Relationship of Loyalty

### Lawyer vs Client's interest

* ASCR r 12
* Financial
* sexual not ruled but better avoid
* ***Spector v Ageda***: not only discharge but manifest it
	

### Clients vs Clients

r 10, 11



#### current clients' interest
 
r 11 
 
joint representation: allowed but fraught with danger

No, unless consent

the consent must be informed consent, and the client consent either to share info or to utilize an information barrier (11.4)

**Justice Cummins:** Prohibition of conflict is prophylactic, no consequence is no excuse

11.5 when actual conflict happens, can only serve one of them

#### current client vs former client

r 10

* **material** + **detriment**
* unless consent/barrier wall


#### Continued loyalty

***Spincode***: loyalty cannot be extinguished by the termination of the contract



## Different kinds of lawyers:

RL: fidelity to the court, so consent may not be enough
MA: consent is unnecessary
EoC: communication openly, then needs to be consented
