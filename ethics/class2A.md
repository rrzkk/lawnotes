### J R Sternlight & J K Robbennolt (2013) ‘Behavioral Legal Ethics’ Scholarly Works. Paper 883. Read Parts I-III

**Intro: psychology for ethics**

1.  **_Bounded Ethics_**: ethical blind spots, slippery slopes & ethical fading
	* **Blind Spot**: 
		* tend to believe we are objective
		* tend to make inacurate forecast of themselves (focus more on idealistic self rather than pragmatic self)
	*  **slippery slopes and Boiling Frogs**
	* **Ethical fading**: 
		* Scripts: certain routine decisions or practices
		* Euphemisms: effects of languages
		* advantageous comparison
		* moral intensity influenced by nature, maginitude, probability and timing of potential consequence
		* more corruptably when facing loss compared to gain, and more corruptably when **just short**
		* 
2. **_Ethics in law practice_**: *complexity and ambiguouty, factors to affect the lawyers' decisions
	* **Ethical Rules and Standard:**
		* conflict
		* help lawyer to justify their unethical decisions
		* lawyers not complaint with rules that they treat as illegitimate
	* **Agency relationship**
		* conflict interest (conflict between principle and lawyer)
		* disclosure and conflict
			* disclosure no decreasing trust
			* clients does not want to seignal her distrust
			* disclosure distortion
			 
		* acting unethically indirectly
			* omission bias: prefer inaction to action
			* prone to act unethically when there is an agent
		* Benefits of agency relationship
			*  lawyers can see the ethical contours which faded for the client
			*  lawyerscan notice better slippery slope due to periodic nature of the job
			*  client pront to listen advice from lawyer
	* **Adversarial system:** (zealous advocacy)
		* morally justified agaisnt hostility
		* response to unethical opponents
	* **The tolls of law practice:**
		* stress, lack of sleep, economic pressures
	* **Status and Power:**
		* Higher status, more unethical
		* Good thing is that they dont need to worry about power and do trade-off due to it
	* **Social Actors:**
		* Influence from authority 
		* Influence from group in which he/she is a member
		* pluralistic ignorance: if no one object, no amiss
		* illusion of transparency: ppl are more concerned than they look
		* diffusion of responsibility: no one will be responsible
	* **reponding to others' ethicality**
		* actor observer bias: tend to see others' unethicality more easily
		* **However**, we find it hard to respond to ohters' unethical behavior: focus more own matters, motivated blindness, moral licensing (they hav done other things right), incrementally degrading behavior(hard to notice), outcome bias (good result means good ethics)
		* illusion of courage: we though we can say, but we can't
3. **_difficulty to recognize and learn from past_**
	* cognitive dissonance (reconsile with ourselves, we convince ourselves that we are not wrong)
	* confirmation bias and omission bias will help us to convince ourselves
	* Our past behaviors changes who we are now

### H Breakey (2017) ‘ Building Ethics Regimes: Capabilities, Obstacles and Supports for Professional Ethical Decision-Making

6 stages

| Stages | moral factors |   
|---|---|
|awareness| moral sensetivity (empathy, attention, perceptiveness and curiosity)|
|judgement|moral reflectiveness (conscious, deliberate and highly rational reasoning capabilities)|
|decision making| **moral motive**(against contervailing desire such as self-interest or group interest)| 
|action| moral charactor(virtues such as courage, patience, concentration etc)|
|achievement|moral competence (interpersonal exp, specialised expertise, strategic nous and social skills)| 
|review|reflectiveness| 


moral motives+ moral capabilities + feasible actions = principled moral action

* **moral sensetivity**:
	* general: from education etc
	* specialized: good listenting skills etc
	* **obstacle**: 
		* script
		* compassion fatigue: caused from stress, lack of spleep etc
* **moral reflectiveness**:
	* include rational reasonable etc, but also the  capacity to uncover alternative courses of action
	* **obstacle**:
		* cognitive distortion: over optimistic or under confident
		* normative thinking: for example, misplaced loyalty
		* excuses
* **Moral motive**
	* common morality, desirable role-identity, excelence, fair bargains, contructed virtus and deserved approbation
	* **Obstacles** : misplaced loyalties, ego, narcissistiv desire etc
	
* **moral character**
	* for example, detached concern generated from role-based cognitive traits
	* no obstacles
	
* **coral competence**
	*  no real obstacle like character above, however, knowledge update may be obstacle

	--
* **General obstacles:**
	* substance abuse and stress
	* work env
	* compartmentalisation (devide work and life too much)
	* blockers

* **ambivalent obstacles and supports**
	* market forces
* **capabilities and moral motives**: mutual affected


> 	The deontological approach takes a rule-based approach to deciding ethical issues. Whether an action is right or wrong depends on whether the action itself complies with a set of rules –  the approach ‘emphasises the rightness of ‘process’ rather than the ultimate consequences’. It is about maintaining the order, based on defined principles, without deviating even for ‘the greater good’.
> 	
> 	The consequentialist approach emphasises the results of actions. Whether an action is right or wrong depends on its consequences. This means that sometimes, if the ‘greater good’ would be served, a decision that otherwise might be considered ‘wrong’ might be acceptable. An extreme example might be justifying ‘the death of a few people from induced bird flu, in order to save many by helping to develop a vaccine against the virus.’
